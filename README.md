Optimization algorithms:Stochastic gradient  descent
Tools:pytorch
Loss function : Cross entropy

Steps to execute the above file:
   --> Except 1 small issue in executing everything is fine.
   --> I trained  VGGNET 2 times . 1st time i trained without using "pretrained=True"  so because of that it will take soo much time for                    training. I did that because to compare the use of writing "Pretrained=True". so while running we can ignore that small code part and we can run code
