CNN Architectures used : Vgg16,Google net,ZFnet
Optimization algorithms : stochastic gradient descent
Loss Function: Cross entropy

Steps to run code:
   
   
   ->> There is one small problem in running code. I used vgg16 2 times 1st time i used without "pretrained=True" so it will take soo much time for training . 2nd time i used with "pretrained=True".. So please ignore that part of code (with out "Pretrained=True").
